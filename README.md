jQuery FineBox plugin
=================================

Ok there is already tons of existing lightbox plugins, why create another one ? The first goal was to create a jQuery version of the nice Highslide JS media viewer. At this step, the engine is stable even if is not very lightweight. I will take more time soon to describe all existing features (history, permalinks, hook pattern, etc.).
